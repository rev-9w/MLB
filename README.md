#The MinneMUDAC 2023 Challenge 

### Centered on America’s National Pastime – Baseball!  Participants of this year’s student data challenge will be required to gain an understanding of how various factors influence attendance at Major League Baseball (MLB) games.  

MinneMUDAC 2023 has teamed up with the MN Twins for this year’s challenge.  Student teams should consider the Minnesota Twins / MLB as their clients for this year’s challenge.  Each team will be required to present their outcomes/findings in-person at Target Field on March 25.  Student teams will give their 6-8 minute presentation to a group of judges (a judge group consists of 2-3 working professionals in analytics).  Teams will give their presentation repeatedly – likely between 4 and 6 times.  Outcomes will be evaluated using the published rubric for this year’s challenge.
